In this work, we public avaialbel two task-oriented conversational datasets joined with a knowledge graph, Task2KB.

The links to access each dataset as well as the knowledge graph are given as follows:

The data are presented as per different categories with json format, which allow them to be easy access.

We also public available the code in developing the question generators with T5/Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models, as well as the code
for fine-tuning a response generator based upon the generated datasets.
